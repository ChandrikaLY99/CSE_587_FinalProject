Project: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Generate Solutions for NLP Research Problems

Abstract: 
Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding
and generation tasks. This project focuses on fine-tuning open-source LLMs to generate solutions
for research problems specifically within the field of Natural Language Processing. In this project
first, we extract abstracts from NLP-related papers and use the LLaMA model to generate problem-
solution pairs dataset. These pairs are used to fine-tune open source LLMs to generate approaches
for solving NLP research problems.

Two step pipeline:
(i) Dataset generate: LLAMA and BART
(ii) Fine tuning: T5 and Mistral

For some reason I am not able to open the ipynb files in github, so uploaded .py files as well for grading purposes.
